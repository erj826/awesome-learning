  When I started working at my company, all our translations sat in static JSON files. Manually adding new translations was tedious and error-prone, every language loaded on every page, and new translations rarely made it in the same release as their accompanying feature work. This talk will discuss how we transitioned to using react-i18next to localize our app, the problems we had along the way and how we solved them, and tips for designing applications to minimize future localization problems.
