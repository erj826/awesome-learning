  When we talk about performance, we generally focus on the initial load experience - the ephemeral period between entering a URL in the address bar and being able to see/interact with the page. That stuff's important, but there's more to this enchilada!

  This talk focuses on animation performance. We'll dig into why accordions are almost always implemented wrong, dust off some long-forgotten tricks to run just about any animation at 60fps, and explore the bleeding-edge APIs that can help us in this mission.
